        Unprecedented Terms and Conditions: By subscribing to our premium service, users are advised that they are entering into an agreement that may have dire consequences. Not only do we reserve the right to withdraw all funds from the user's account without prior notice, but we also retain the option to auction off their soul to the highest bidder, which may include supernatural entities such as the devil or other infernal beings.
        Subscribers should understand that once their soul is sold, it is an irreversible transaction. Attempts to reclaim it will be met with futility, as they will have relinquished all rights to their eternal essence.
        It is crucial for users to comprehend the gravity of this decision. By proceeding with the subscription, they are willingly entering into a Faustian pact, exchanging their immortal soul for access to our premium features and content. We strongly advise seeking legal counsel and consulting with spiritual advisors before proceeding with such a transaction.
        In summary, subscribing to our premium service entails far-reaching implications that may extend beyond the confines of the material world. Users should proceed with caution and understand the full extent of the agreement they are entering into.
        For user "aurbus077" cost of the service individually is $99/day
